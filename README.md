# wireframeshader
A deforming wireframe shader for a visualisation project in Unity

This is a shader and a script that allows you to have multiple instances of the shader in scene with different effects by utlising MaterialPropertyBlocks.

I've been using it to visualise emotions on objects, hence the names!
